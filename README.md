#  GraphQL

I saw a job posting yesterday for a position I was interested in.  The requirements were somewhat generic for a mobile app developer position.
But on the second to last line of the job requirements I saw this:

 • Hands-on coding experience with GraphQL is a plus.

Well, there's no way I'm going to hit the **Apply Here** button without finding out a bit about GraphQL. 

And yes, I had never heard of it! 

No, I haven't been living under a rock.

What I found after a couple of hours of clicking, reading and viewing convinced me that this is an important technology that every mobile app developer of apps with large-scale data needs should be aware of and fluent in.
You can accuse me of drinking the Kool-Aid, but take a look at Steven Luscher's demo (linked below) before dismissing the topic.

# Zero to GraphQL in 30 Minutes – Steven Luscher

Even dog and pony show veterans will be dazzled and amazed at this presentation by Steven.
You might think it ambitious to attempt to describe the adoption of an api and integrating the back/front end in 30 minutes,
imagine watching him do it for 3 different backends (django, ruby on rails, epress (node)) - and in the final 5 minutes of that half hour, he will show you how to reduce the network traffic even further with a concrete example.

The earlier materials stressed the ease of adoption of GraphQL. This is proof that it wasn't hype.

Here's a soup-to-nuts compendium to introduce you to the entire process of creating an app that makes use of GraphQL

A Blog, a video and working source code from GitHub will get you on your way almost immediately.
